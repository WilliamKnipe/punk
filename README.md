# PUNK API

Project uses HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (async fetch api). Doesn't require setup, simply runs in the browser.

Very simple project messing around with Punk API

Didn't build it to be mobile first so it isn't responsive, maybe that is something I will add in later when I have a spare five minutes.
