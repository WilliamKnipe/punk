# PUNK API

Demo uses HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (async fetch api). Doesn't require setup, simply open the index file in the browser.

Very simple project that uses Punk API. Returns data and creates objects for each beer. Each beer is listed and when you click a beer more beer information for that object is displayed in the sidebar.

Just a quick demo, didn't build it mobile first (I am a disgrace).
